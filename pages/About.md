# Welcome to My Website!

I'm Enoch Clements. I've been working with computers my whole life: I
became a "power user" of MS Windows in middle school (with Win7!), I
learned Python several years later. After that, I fell in love with
Linux & Open Source
Software, and learned to care about my online privacy. I'm currently
learning Rust. I'm looking to develop my skills in both these languages
via contributing to FOSS Software. I'm currently in college, studying
for a degree in Computer Science, which I'm planning on using for either
Software Engineering, or (Linux) System Administration. In general, I
hate web development, so this site will probably never be more than a
static site.
